## Overview

### The challenge

Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a calculator that can do the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The input takes place via the keyboard of the pocket calculator (buttons).

- find your own design and build the most beautiful calculator in the world ;)
- find out about JS eval() for the calculation.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- JavaScript

### Continued Development

- make % work
- make C work and remove the last entry, not the last number or letter
- fill display with 0 as default and overwite on input
- find an alternative for eval() as it should not be used anymore
